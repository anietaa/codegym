Use a loop to write a countdown from 10 to 0. To create a delay, use Thread.sleep(100);
Wrap the sleep call in a try-catch block.

Requirements:
•	The program should display a countdown from 10 to 0.
•	The program should display a new number every 100 milliseconds.
•	The program should use "Thread.sleep(100);".
•	The main method must have a try-catch block.
•	The main method should not throw exceptions.

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 10; i >= 0; i--) {
            System.out.println(i);

           try {
    Thread.sleep(100);
} catch (InterruptedException ie) {
    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
}
        }
    }
}
