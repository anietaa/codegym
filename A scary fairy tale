1. Once there were five classes: red riding hood, grandmother, pie, woodcutter, and wolf.
2. Each class has 2 fields: ArrayList killed and ArrayList ate.
3. The necessary objects have been created (hood, grandmother, ...).
4. Arrange the relationships correctly according to who ate and/or killed who in the fairy tale "Little Red Riding Hood".

PS: Nobody ate the pie. It was only carried in a basket. The wolf ate a little. And then he was killed.

Requirements:
The main method should change the state (internal variables) of the wolf object.
The main method should change the state (internal variables) of the woodcutter object.
Nobody ate the pie.
The wolf ate a little.
And then the wolf was killed.
