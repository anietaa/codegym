Write a program that will read numbers from the keyboard.
The code for reading numbers from the keyboard must be in the readData method.
Wrap the code inside readData in a try-catch block.
If the user enters text instead of a number, then the method should catch an exception and then display all previously entered numbers.
Display each number on a new line in the same order it was entered.

Requirements:
The program must read data from the keyboard.
Don't change the main method.
The main method should not throw exceptions.
The readData method must contain a try-catch block.
If the user enters text rather than a number, the program should display all previously entered numbers.
