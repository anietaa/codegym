Correct the code so the program will compile.

Hint:
The getChild method must remain abstract.

Requirements:
The Pet class must be static.
The Pet class must have two methods.
The getChild() method must be abstract.
The Pet class must be declared with a modifier that prevents the creation of objects of this class.
