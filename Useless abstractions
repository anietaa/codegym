You need to place the abstract keyword in the right places so that the program will compile.
Add abstract where needed and delete it where it isn't needed.

Requirements:
The Pegasus class must implement the CanFly interface.
The Pegasus class must inherit the Horse class.
The SwimmingPegasus class must inherit the Pegasus class.
You should be able to create a Horse object.
You should be able to create a Pegasus object.
The SwimmingPegasus class's swim() method must not be implemented.
