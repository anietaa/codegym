Add as many interfaces to the Human class as possible, but be sure that it doesn't become an abstract class.
You can't add methods to the Human class.

Requirements:
•	The Solution class must have an Employee interface with a void workLazily() method.
•	The Solution class must have a Businessman interface with a void workHard() method.
•	The Solution class must have a Secretary interface with a void workLazily() method.
•	The Solution class must have a Miner interface with a void workVeryHard() method.
•	The Solution class must have a Human class with the methods: void workHard() and void workLazily().
•	The Human class must implement three interfaces.
