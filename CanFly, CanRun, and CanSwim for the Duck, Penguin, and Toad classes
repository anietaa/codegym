The CanFly, CanSwim, and CanRun interfaces have already been written for you.
Add these interfaces to the Duck, Penguin, and Toad classes.

Requirements:
The Solution class must have a CanFly interface with a void fly() method.
The Solution class must have a CanSwim interface with a void swim() method.
The Solution class must have a CanRun interface with a void run() method.
The Solution class must have Duck, Penguin, and Toad classes.
A Duck object must be able to fly (support the CanFly interface), run (support the CanRun interface), and swim (support the CanSwim interface).
A Penguin object must be able to run (support the CanRun interface) and swim (support the CanSwim interface).
A Toad object must only be able to swim (support the CanSwim interface).
